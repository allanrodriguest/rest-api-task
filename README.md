## 🛠️Tech used:

- Javascript
- Nodejs
- Express
- MongoDB

## 🚀 Optimizations

In the near future I will be looking to improve it. It still needs a front-end, could either be Javascript Templates using EJS or in React. Also, I will be hosting it on Heroku, in order to non-tech people be able to access it.

## 💻 Lessons Learned:

I could get a better understanding on creating APIs from scratch. Firstly, by installing the dependencies, such as express, cors, bodyparser, nodemon (only for run locally), and dotenv. Secondly, I feel amazed on how you can hide your MongoDB login information, on my past projects it was always exposed. It was also the first time that I tried out Mongoose, it makes the Schema and document manipulation on MongoDB even simplier. Lastly, I started to apply MVC, having a design pattern improves your code readability and could be maintanable by anyone.
